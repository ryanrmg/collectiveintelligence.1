Supervised versus Unsupervised Learning
    Supervised learning
        techniques that use example inputs and outputs to learn how to make predictions
            examples:
                neural networks
                decision trees
                support-vector machines
                Bayesian filtering
    Unsupervised learning
        is not trained with correct vs incorrect
        goal : find structure within a set of data where no one piece of data is the answer
        take the data and find distinct groups that exist within the data
            examples:
            clustering
            non-negative matrix factorization
            self-organizing maps

often necessary to cluster on both rows and columns
    examples:
        find items that are commonly bought together
        find words that are commonly used together
        
K-means clustering 
    much more efficient
