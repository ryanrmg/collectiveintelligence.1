Searching and Ranking
Search Engine
	crawling
	-BeautifulSoup and urllib to index and crawl links
	-find text elements 
	-strips html of tags and separates words 
	fixed set of documents
Content-Based Ranking
	-Word Frequency
		-The number of times the words in the query appear in the document
	-Document Location
		-The main subject of a document will probably appear near the begining.
	-Word distance
		-If there are multiple words in a query, they should appear close together in the document
Inbound Links
	-pages where the url has been referenced or linked
	-academic papers use this often
PageRank
	-probability that someone randomly clicks on a page
	-idea: more links -> higher probability

Neural Networks
	learn to associate searches with results based on what links people click after they get a list of search results
	consist of a set of nodes and connections
Multilayer Perceptron Network (MLP)
	multiple layers of neurons
		first layer takes the input 
		last layer gives the output
	power in a neural network is that it can make predictions based on similar queries to give results for queries that it has never seen before
	neural networks use sigmoid functions
	-tanh
