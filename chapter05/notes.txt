Optimization
	-finds the best solution to a problem by trying many different solutions and scoring them to determine their quality
Cost Function
	in group travel example:
	-Price : total cost
	-Travel time : time everyone spends traveling
	-Waiting time : time spent waiting for other members and in connections
	-Departure time : traveling at early or late times
	-car rental : return the car in timely manor
Random Searching
	-the least efficient, not a very good optimization method
Hill Climbing
	-starts with random solutions and looks for neighboring solutions that are better
	-could get stuck at local min instead of global min
Simulated Annealing
	-starts with random solution and changes a single variable to find a lower solution
	-similar to hill climbing but attempts to avoid local mins
Genetic Algorithms
	-initially create a set of random solutions known as the population
	-top solutions are added to new population called the next generation
	-mutation: small, simple, random change by changing a single number
	-crossover/breeding: involves taking two of the best solutions and combining them
